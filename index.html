	          <li><strong>1980</strong> - climbers hop fence of Lick Hollow, the land that would eventually become Horseshoe Caynon Ranch, to climb the cracks available in the west caynon walls.</li>
	          <li><strong>1990</strong> - By the mid 1990's virtually every quality crack climb had seen its <abbr class="initialism" title="First Ascent">FA</abbr>. Most of which claimed by Craig Thomas, Barry Bisswanger. Alf Carter, and Tony Morris.</li>
	          <li><strong>1995</strong> - Barry and Amy Johnson purchased a 500-acre valley in northern Arkansas with plans to open a dude ranch.</li>
	          <li><strong>1998</strong> - The first sport route on the ranch, Rosie's Cantina (5.9), is established by Todd Miller.</li>
	          <li><strong>1999</strong> - A number of classic lines are bolted including Horseshoe and Hand Grenades (5.11a), The Farrier (5.11d) and Portside (5.10d).</li>
	          <li><strong>2001</strong> - Justin Frese enters the canyon and focuses on developing and cataloging boulder lines.</li>

	          </blockquote>  By end of year the <abbr class="initialism" title="Horseshoe Canyon Ranch">HCR</abbr> boasted more than 100 bolted lines, increasing the state's previous tally of sport routes by nearly 70%.  Blake Strickland joins the bouldering scene and establishes stout classics such as Flash Gordon (V10), Fading Light (V8), and Bushido (V8).</li>
	          <li><strong>2003</strong> - Nathaniel Walker bolts the first 5.13s in the ranch: Envy, Venus Butterfly and Craddle of the Deep. </li>
	          <li><strong>2004</strong> - Big Up Production features Chris Sharma completing an array of difficult bolder climbs in the film Dosage 3.</li>
	          <li><strong>2005</strong> - Chris Sharma repoints The Prophet Project, the hardest climb the ranch cliffs have to offer.  Although Chris refused to grade the climb, those who followed dubbed it a 5.14a making it the only 5.14 in Arkansas.</li>
	          <li><strong>2006</strong> - Route development slows as most of the quality 5.10 and above climbs bolted.  Setters chase their gaze to other underdeveloped potential across Arkansas and leave the Canyon.</li>
	          <li><strong>2008</strong> - First 24 Hours of Horseshoe Canyon Hell competition is held an event where climbers see how many routes they can climb within a 24 hour window.  Knews of the competition spread and bolting interest in the caynon regrows.  Many lower grade wals are bolted such as The Land Beyond, The Middle East, and Cliffs of Insanity.</li>
	          <li><strong>2013</strong> - Sport route count at the canyon continues to rises reaching 415.</li>
